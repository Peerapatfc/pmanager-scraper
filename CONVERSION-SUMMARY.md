- Affected Quality
- Potential
- Penalties

- Last Updated timestamp

### 3. **Google Sheets Integration**
- Automatic authentication via service account
- Smart upsert logic (updates existing, adds new)
- Formatted headers
- Auto-resized columns

## Key Files

- `scrape-all-with-details.php` - Main scraper
- `src/GoogleSheetsManager.php` - Google Sheets integration
- `composer.json` - PHP dependencies
- `.env` - Configuration (credentials)

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
composer install

# Run the scraper
php scrape-all-with-details.php
```

## Important Technical Details

### Value Field Challenge & Solution
The "Value" field was tricky because:
1. It's on the Contract tab (not the default Information tab)
2. The tab is JavaScript-based
3. Solution: Load page with `#info` hash fragment
4. Extract using JavaScript: `window.location.hash = 'info'`
5. Format conversion: "60.017.450 baht" → "60,017,450"

### Pagination Fix
- Original issue: CSS selector `:contains()` doesn't work in Symfony Panther
- Solution: Iterate through all `<td>` elements and check text with PHP `strpos()`

### Performance
- ~38 minutes to scrape all 1,118 players
- Includes 200-500ms delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
- Loads Contract tab (`#info`) for each player to get Value field

## Differences from Node.js Version

| Feature | Node.js | PHP |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Browser automation | Playwright | Symfony Panther |
| Google Sheets | googleapis npm | google/apiclient |
| Selectors | `:has-text()` | JavaScript execution + PHP text matching |
| Performance | Slightly faster | ~Same (38 min for all) |

## Next Steps

The scraper is production-ready! You can:
1. Run it manually: `php scrape-all-with-details.php`
2. Set up a cron job for automatic daily runs
3. Check results in your Google Sheet
